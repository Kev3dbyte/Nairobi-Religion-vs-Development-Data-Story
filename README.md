# Nairobi Youth Development & Opportunity Imbalance: A Data Story

## Project Overview

This project explores the relationship between religious center densityâ€”industries and empowermwnt centers and youth population across sub-counties in Nairobi, Kenya. It aims to visualize and analyze the disparities, particularly focusing on the apparent imbalance where "hope" represented by religious centers is everywhere, but opportunities represented by industries and empowerment centers are "scarce" for the youth which suggest an underinvestment in critical development sectors compared to religious infrastructure.

## Problem Statement

Nairobi like many global rapidly urbanizing areas, faces significant challenges related to youth unemployment and underdevelopment with many sources citing Kenya youth unemployement as 11.9%. The World Bank has also indicated that 75% of Kenya's youth those between 15 and 35 years face are grappling with unemployment or underemployment which is despite a visible proliferation of religious centers that continue to sprout everywhere in the country and especially Nairobi the cxapital city. Therefore, this project investigates whether the distribution of development opportunities (industries and empowerment centers) aligns with or diverges from the presence of religious institutions, and how this relates to the youth demographic across different sub-counties in the city. The goal is to provide data-driven insights into potential imbalances and areas requiring targeted intervention with the aim of sparking useful debates that leads to matching development investment to the currently ongoing religion boom. 

## Project Objectives

The primary objectives of this data analysis project were to;

* **Quantify the Density:** Accurately measure and compare the density of religious centers, formal industries, and empowerment institutions per 10,000 youth across Nairobi's sub-counties.
* **Identify Disparities:** Uncover specific sub-counties exhibiting significant imbalances between religious infrastructure and development opportunities.
* **Visualize the Landscape:** Create an interactive and intuitive dashboard to effectively communicate these spatial and numerical disparities.
* **Inform Policy or Intervention:** Provide clear, data-driven insights that can inform discussions around targeted youth development initiatives and resource allocation.


## Data Sources
